    "4- Click Open….\n",
    "5- Navigate to the \"etc\" folder. To do so:\n",
    "6- Click the \"Text Documents (*.txt)\" box. \n",
    "7- Click All Files. \n",
    "8- Remove security from the \"hosts\" file. Find the \"hosts\" file in the main Notepad window, then do the following:\n",
    "    Right-click the \"hosts\" file.\n",
    "    Click Properties in the drop-down menu.\n",

    "    Type in 127.0.0.1 and press Tab ↹.\n",
    "    Type in a website's address without the \"www\" section (e.g., \"facebook.com\", \"twitter.com\").\n",
    "    Press ↵ Enter to start a new line, then repeat the above two steps with other addresses you want to block.\n",
    "12- Block Google Chrome sites using this method. While you can block sites in most browsers using the above step, Google Chrome     is slightly different: if you're blocking sites on Google Chrome, you'll need to place a space and then the \"www.               [site].com\" version of the website's address after the \"[site].com\" version.\n",
    "    To block Facebook, for example, you would type in 127.0.0.1 facebook.com www.facebook.com.\n",
    "    Adding the \"http://\" or \"https://\" part of the address as well (e.g., 127.0.0.1 facebook.com https://www.facebook.com can       improve the chances of the site being blocked.\n",
    "13- Replace the existing \"hosts\" file with the edited one.\n",
    "14- Flush your computer's DNS cache. You'll use Command Prompt to perform this action.\n",
    "15- Restart all browsers.\n",
